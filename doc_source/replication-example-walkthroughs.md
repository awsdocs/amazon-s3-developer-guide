# Replication walkthroughs<a name="replication-example-walkthroughs"></a>

The following examples show how to configure replication for common use cases\. The examples demonstrate replication configuration using the Amazon S3 console, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), and AWS SDKs \(Java and \.NET SDK examples are shown\)\. For information about installing and configuring the AWS CLI, see the following topics in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.
+  [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) 
+  [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) \- You must set up at least one profile\. If you are exploring cross\-account scenarios, set up two profiles\.

For information about AWS SDKs, see [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/) and [AWS SDK for \.NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/)\.
