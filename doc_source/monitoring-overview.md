# Monitoring Amazon S3<a name="monitoring-overview"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon S3 and your AWS solutions\. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multipoint failure if one occurs\. But before you start monitoring Amazon S3, you should create a monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions:
+ What are your monitoring goals?
+ What resources will you monitor?
+ How often will you monitor these resources?
+ What monitoring tools will you use?
+ Who will perform the monitoring tasks?
+ Who should be notified when something goes wrong?
