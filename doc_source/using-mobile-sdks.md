You can use the AWS Mobile SDKs for Android and iOS, together with [AWS Mobile Hub](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home#/), to quickly and easily integrate robust cloud backends into your existing mobile apps\. You can configure and use features like user sign\-in, databases, push notifications, and more, without being an AWS expert\. 

The AWS Mobile SDKs provide easy access to Amazon S3 and many other AWS services\. To get started using the AWS Mobile SDKs, see [Getting Started with the AWS Mobile SDKs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com//aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html)\.
