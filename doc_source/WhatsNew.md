| Root domain support for website hosting | Amazon S3 now supports hosting static websites at the root domain\. Visitors to your website can access your site from their browser without specifying "www" in the web address \(e\.g\., "example\.com"\)\. Many customers already host static websites on Amazon S3 that are accessible from a "www" subdomain \(e\.g\., "www\.example\.com"\)\. Previously, to support root domain access, you needed to run your own web server to proxy root domain requests from browsers to your website on Amazon S3\. Running a web server to proxy requests introduces additional costs, operational burden, and another potential point of failure\. Now, you can take advantage of the high availability and durability of Amazon S3 for both "www" and root domain addresses\. For more information, see [Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\. | December 27, 2012  |

You can easily set the rules on a bucket using the Amazon S3 console or programmatically using the Amazon S3 API or AWS SDKs\. For more information, see [Object Lifecycle Management](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)\.   | November 13, 2012  | 
| Support for Website Page Redirects |  For a bucket that is configured as a website, Amazon S3 now supports redirecting a request for an object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL\. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Configuring a Webpage Redirect](how-to-page-redirect.md)\.  For information about hosting websites, see [Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\.   | October 4, 2012  | 
| Support for Cross\-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\) |  Amazon S3 now supports Cross\-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\)\. CORS defines a way in which client web applications that are loaded in one domain can interact with or access resources in a different domain\. With CORS support in Amazon S3, you can build rich client\-side web applications on top of Amazon S3 and selectively allow cross\-domain access to your Amazon S3 resources\. For more information, see [Cross\-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\)](cors.md)\.  | August 31, 2012 | 
| Support for Cost Allocation Tags | Amazon S3 now supports cost allocation tagging, which allows you to label S3 buckets so you can more easily track their cost against projects or other criteria\. For more information about using tagging for buckets, see [Using Cost Allocation S3 Bucket Tags](CostAllocTagging.md)\. | August 21, 2012 | 
| Support for MFA\-protected API access in bucket policies  |  Amazon S3 now supports MFA\-protected API access, a feature that can enforce AWS Multi\-Factor Authentication for an extra level of security when accessing your Amazon S3 resources\. It is a security feature that requires users to prove physical possession of an MFA device by providing a valid MFA code\. For more information, go to [AWS Multi\-Factor Authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/)\. You can now require MFA authentication for any requests to access your Amazon S3 resources\.  To enforce MFA authentication, Amazon S3 now supports the `aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` key in a bucket policy\. For an example bucket policy, see [Adding a Bucket Policy to Require MFA](example-bucket-policies.md#example-bucket-policies-use-case-7)\. | July 10, 2012 |

|  Support for sending requests using temporary security credentials   |  In addition to using your AWS account and IAM user security credentials to send authenticated requests to Amazon S3, you can now send requests using temporary security credentials you obtain from AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. You can use the AWS Security Token Service API or the AWS SDK wrapper libraries to request these temporary credentials from IAM\. You can request these temporary security credentials for your own use or hand them out to federated users and applications\. This feature enables you to manage your users outside AWS and provide them with temporary security credentials to access your AWS resources\.  For more information, see [Making Requests](MakingRequests.md)\. For more information about IAM support for temporary security credentials, see [Temporary Security Credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.  | August 3, 2011 | 
|  Multipart Upload API extended to enable copying objects up to 5 TB  |  Prior to this release, Amazon S3 API supported copying objects of up to 5 GB in size\. To enable copying objects larger than 5 GB, Amazon S3 now extends the multipart upload API with a new operation, `Upload Part (Copy)`\. You can use this multipart upload operation to copy objects up to 5 TB in size\. For more information, see [Copying Objects](CopyingObjectsExamples.md)\.  For conceptual information about multipart upload API, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload API](uploadobjusingmpu.md)\.   | June 21, 2011 | 
|  SOAP API calls over HTTP disabled  |  To increase security, SOAP API calls over HTTP are disabled\. Authenticated and anonymous SOAP requests must be sent to Amazon S3 using SSL\.  | June 6, 2011 | 
|  IAM enables cross\-account delegation   |  Previously, to access an Amazon S3 resource, an IAM user needed permissions from both the parent AWS account and the Amazon S3 resource owner\. With cross\-account access, the IAM user now only needs permission from the owner account\. That is, If a resource owner grants access to an AWS account, the AWS account can now grant its IAM users access to these resources\.  For more information, see [Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an IAM User](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.  For more information on specifying principals in a bucket policy, see [Specifying a Principal in a Policy](s3-bucket-user-policy-specifying-principal-intro.md)\.  | June 6, 2011 | 
|  New link  |  This service's endpoint information is now located in the AWS General Reference\. For more information, go to Regions and Endpoints in [AWS General Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)\.  | March 1, 2011 | 
|  Support for hosting static websites in Amazon S3  |  Amazon S3 introduces enhanced support for hosting static websites\. This includes support for index documents and custom error documents\. When using these features, requests to the root of your bucket or a subfolder \(e\.g\., `http://mywebsite.com/subfolder`\) returns your index document instead of the list of objects in your bucket\. If an error is encountered, Amazon S3 returns your custom error message instead of an Amazon S3 error message\. For more information, see [Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\.  |  February 17, 2011  | 
|  Response Header API Support  |  The GET Object REST API now allows you to change the response headers of the REST GET Object request for each request\. That is, you can alter object metadata in the response, without altering the object itself\. For more information, see [Getting Objects](GettingObjectsUsingAPIs.md)\.  |  January 14, 2011  | 
|  Large object support  |  Amazon S3 has increased the maximum size of an object you can store in an S3 bucket from 5 GB to 5 TB\. If you are using the REST API you can upload objects of up to 5 GB size in a single PUT operation\. For larger objects, you must use the Multipart Upload REST API to upload objects in parts\. For more information, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload API](uploadobjusingmpu.md)\.  |  December 9, 2010  | 
|  Multipart upload  |  Multipart upload enables faster, more flexible uploads into Amazon S3\. It allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts\. For more information, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload API](uploadobjusingmpu.md)\.  |  November 10, 2010  | 
|  Canonical ID support in bucket policies  |  You can now specify canonical IDs in bucket policies\. For more information, see [Access Policy Language Overview](access-policy-language-overview.md)   |  September 17, 2010  | 
|  Amazon S3 works with IAM  |  This service now integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. For more information, go to [AWS Services That Work with IAM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.   |  September 2, 2010  | 
| Notifications | The Amazon S3 notifications feature enables you to configure a bucket so that Amazon S3 publishes a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic when Amazon S3 detects a key event on a bucket\. For more information, see [Setting Up Notification of Bucket Events](NotificationHowTo.md)\. | July 14, 2010 | 
| Bucket policies | Bucket policies is an access management system you use to set access permissions across buckets, objects, and sets of objects\. This functionality supplements and in many cases replaces access control lists\. For more information, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](using-iam-policies.md)\. | July 6, 2010 | 
| Path\-style syntax available in all regions | Amazon S3 now supports the path\-style syntax for any bucket in the US Classic Region, or if the bucket is in the same region as the endpoint of the request\. For more information, see [Virtual Hosting](VirtualHosting.md)\. | June 9, 2010 | 
| New endpoint for EU \(Ireland\) | Amazon S3 now provides an endpoint for EU \(Ireland\): http://s3\-eu\-west\-1\.amazonaws\.com\. | June 9, 2010 | 
| Console | You can now use Amazon S3 through the AWS Management Console\. You can read about all of the Amazon S3 functionality in the console in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide\.  | June 9, 2010 | 
| Reduced Redundancy | Amazon S3 now enables you to reduce your storage costs by storing objects in Amazon S3 with reduced redundancy\. For more information, see [Reduced Redundancy Storage](Introduction.md#RRS)\. | May 12, 2010 | 
| New region supported | Amazon S3 now supports the Asia Pacific \(Singapore\) region\. For more information, see [Buckets and Regions](UsingBucket.md#access-bucket-intro)\. | April 28, 2010 | 
| Object Versioning | This release introduces object versioning\. All objects now can have a key and a version\. If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 gives all objects added to a bucket a unique version ID\. This feature enables you to recover from unintended overwrites and deletions\. For more information, see [Versioning](Introduction.md#Versions) and [Using Versioning](Versioning.md)\. | February 8, 2010 | 
| New region supported | Amazon S3 now supports the US West \(N\. California\) region\. The new endpoint for requests to this Region is s3\-us\-west\-1\.amazonaws\.com\. For more information, see [Buckets and Regions](UsingBucket.md#access-bucket-intro)\. | December 2, 2009 | 
| AWS SDK for \.NET | AWS now provides libraries, sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers who prefer to build applications using \.NET language\-specific API operations instead of REST or SOAP\. These libraries provide basic functions \(not included in the REST or SOAP APIs\), such as request authentication, request retries, and error handling so that it's easier to get started\. For more information about language\-specific libraries and resources, see [Using the AWS SDKs, CLI, and Explorers](UsingAWSSDK.md)\.  | November 11, 2009 |
