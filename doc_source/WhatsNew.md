You can use S3 bucket policies to control access to buckets from specific VPC endpoints, or specific VPCs\. VPC endpoints are easy to configure, are highly reliable, and provide a secure connection to Amazon S3 without requiring a gateway or a NAT instance\. For more information, see [Example Bucket Policies for VPC Endpoints for Amazon S3](example-bucket-policies-vpc-endpoint.md)\.  |  April 29, 2015  | 
| Event notifications |  Amazon S3 event notifications have been updated to support the switch to resource\-based permissions for AWS Lambda functions\. For more information, see [ Configuring Amazon S3 event notifications](NotificationHowTo.md)\.  |  April 9, 2015  | 
| Cross\-Region Replication |  Amazon S3 now supports Cross\-Region Replication\. Cross\-Region Replication is the automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions\. For more information, see [Replication](replication.md)\.  |  March 24, 2015  | 
| Event notifications |  Amazon S3 now supports new event types and destinations in a bucket notification configuration\. Prior to this release, Amazon S3 supported only the *s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject* event type and an Amazon SNS topic as the destination\. For more information about the new event types, see [ Configuring Amazon S3 event notifications](NotificationHowTo.md)\.  |  November 13, 2014  | 
| Server\-side encryption with customer\-provided encryption keys | Server\-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) Amazon S3 now supports server\-side encryption using AWS KMS\. This feature allows you to manage the envelope key through AWS KMS, and Amazon S3 calls AWS KMS to access the envelope key within the permissions you set\.  For more information about server\-side encryption with AWS KMS, see [Protecting Data Using Server\-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html)\.   |  November 12, 2014  | 
| Europe \(Frankfurt\) Region |  Amazon S3 is now available in the Europe \(Frankfurt\) Region\.  | October 23, 2014 | 
| Server\-side encryption with customer\-provided encryption keys |  Amazon S3 now supports server\-side encryption using customer\-provided encryption keys \(SSE\-C\)\. Server\-side encryption enables you to request Amazon S3 to encrypt your data at rest\. When using SSE\-C, Amazon S3 encrypts your objects with the custom encryption keys that you provide\. Since Amazon S3 performs the encryption for you, you get the benefits of using your own encryption keys without the cost of writing or executing your own encryption code\.  For more information about SSE\-C, see [Server\-Side Encryption \(Using Customer\-Provided Encryption Keys\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html)\.  | June 12, 2014 | 
| Lifecycle support for versioning |  Prior to this release, lifecycle configuration was supported only on nonversioned buckets\. Now you can configure lifecycle on both nonversioned and versioning\-enabled buckets\. For more information, see [Object lifecycle management](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)\.   | May 20, 2014 | 
| Access control topics revised |  Revised Amazon S3 access control documentation\. For more information, see [Identity and access management in Amazon S3](s3-access-control.md)\.   | April 15, 2014 |

| IAM policy variable support |  The IAM access policy language now supports variables\. When a policy is evaluated, any policy variables are replaced with values that are supplied by context\-based information from the authenticated user’s session\. You can use policy variables to define general purpose policies without explicitly listing all the components of the policy\. For more information about policy variables, see [IAM Policy Variables Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.  For examples of policy variables in Amazon S3, see [User Policy Examples](example-policies-s3.md)\.   | April 3, 2013 | 
| Console support for Requester Pays | You can now configure your bucket for Requester Pays by using the Amazon S3 console\. For more information, see [Configure Requester Pays by using the Amazon S3 console](configure-requester-pays-console.md)\. | December 31, 2012  | 
| Root domain support for website hosting | Amazon S3 now supports hosting static websites at the root domain\. Visitors to your website can access your site from their browser without specifying "www" in the web address \(e\.g\., "example\.com"\)\. Many customers already host static websites on Amazon S3 that are accessible from a "www" subdomain \(e\.g\., "www\.example\.com"\)\. Previously, to support root domain access, you needed to run your own web server to proxy root domain requests from browsers to your website on Amazon S3\. Running a web server to proxy requests introduces additional costs, operational burden, and another potential point of failure\. Now, you can take advantage of the high availability and durability of Amazon S3 for both "www" and root domain addresses\. For more information, see [Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\. | December 27, 2012  | 
| Console revision | Amazon S3 console has been updated\. The documentation topics that refer to the console have been revised accordingly\. | December 14, 2012  | 
| Support for Archiving Data to S3 Glacier  |  Amazon S3 now supports a storage option that enables you to utilize S3 Glacier's low\-cost storage service for data archival\. To archive objects, you define archival rules identifying objects and a timeline when you want Amazon S3 to archive these objects to S3 Glacier\. You can easily set the rules on a bucket using the Amazon S3 console or programmatically using the Amazon S3 API or AWS SDKs\. For more information, see [Object lifecycle management](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)\.   | November 13, 2012  | 
| Support for Website Page Redirects |  For a bucket that is configured as a website, Amazon S3 now supports redirecting a request for an object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL\. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Configuring a webpage redirect](how-to-page-redirect.md)\.  For information about hosting websites, see [Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\.   | October 4, 2012  | 
| Support for Cross\-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\) |  Amazon S3 now supports Cross\-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\)\. CORS defines a way in which client web applications that are loaded in one domain can interact with or access resources in a different domain\. With CORS support in Amazon S3, you can build rich client\-side web applications on top of Amazon S3 and selectively allow cross\-domain access to your Amazon S3 resources\. For more information, see [Cross\-origin resource sharing \(CORS\)](cors.md)\.  | August 31, 2012 | 
| Support for Cost Allocation Tags | Amazon S3 now supports cost allocation tagging, which allows you to label S3 buckets so you can more easily track their cost against projects or other criteria\. For more information about using tagging for buckets, see [Using cost allocation S3 bucket tags](CostAllocTagging.md)\. | August 21, 2012 | 
| Support for MFA\-protected API access in bucket policies  |  Amazon S3 now supports MFA\-protected API access, a feature that can enforce AWS Multi\-Factor Authentication for an extra level of security when accessing your Amazon S3 resources\. It is a security feature that requires users to prove physical possession of an MFA device by providing a valid MFA code\. For more information, go to [AWS Multi\-Factor Authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/)\. You can now require MFA authentication for any requests to access your Amazon S3 resources\.  To enforce MFA authentication, Amazon S3 now supports the `aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` key in a bucket policy\. For an example bucket policy, see [Adding a Bucket Policy to Require MFA](example-bucket-policies.md#example-bucket-policies-use-case-7)\. | July 10, 2012 | 
| Object Expiration support  | You can use Object Expiration to schedule automatic removal of data after a configured time period\. You set object expiration by adding lifecycle configuration to a bucket\. | 27 December 2011   | 
| New Region supported | Amazon S3 now supports the South America \(São Paulo\) Region\. For more information, see [Accessing a bucket](UsingBucket.md#access-bucket-intro)\. | December 14, 2011 | 
| Multi\-Object Delete | Amazon S3 now supports Multi\-Object Delete API that enables you to delete multiple objects in a single request\. With this feature, you can remove large numbers of objects from Amazon S3 more quickly than using multiple individual DELETE requests\. For more information, see [Deleting objects](DeletingObjects.md)\. | December 7, 2011 | 
| New Region supported | Amazon S3 now supports the US West \(Oregon\) Region\. For more information, see [Buckets and Regions](UsingBucket.md#access-bucket-intro)\. | November 8, 2011 |

|  Server\-side encryption support  |  Amazon S3 now supports server\-side encryption\. It enables you to request Amazon S3 to encrypt your data at rest, that is, encrypt your object data when Amazon S3 writes your data to disks in its data centers\. In addition to REST API updates, the AWS SDK for Java and \.NET provide necessary functionality to request server\-side encryption\. You can also request server\-side encryption when uploading objects using AWS Management Console\. To learn more about data encryption, go to [Using Data Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingEncryption.html)\.  | October 4, 2011 | 
|  Documentation Update   |  In addition to documentation bug fixes, this release includes the following enhancements: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WhatsNew.html)  | September 22, 2011 | 
|  Support for sending requests using temporary security credentials   |  In addition to using your AWS account and IAM user security credentials to send authenticated requests to Amazon S3, you can now send requests using temporary security credentials you obtain from AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. You can use the AWS Security Token Service API or the AWS SDK wrapper libraries to request these temporary credentials from IAM\. You can request these temporary security credentials for your own use or hand them out to federated users and applications\. This feature enables you to manage your users outside AWS and provide them with temporary security credentials to access your AWS resources\.  For more information, see [Making requests](MakingRequests.md)\. For more information about IAM support for temporary security credentials, see [Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.  | August 3, 2011 | 
|  Multipart Upload API extended to enable copying objects up to 5 TB  |  Prior to this release, Amazon S3 API supported copying objects of up to 5 GB in size\. To enable copying objects larger than 5 GB, Amazon S3 now extends the multipart upload API with a new operation, `Upload Part (Copy)`\. You can use this multipart upload operation to copy objects up to 5 TB in size\. For more information, see [Copying objects](CopyingObjectsExamples.md)\.  For conceptual information about multipart upload API, see [Uploading objects using multipart upload API](uploadobjusingmpu.md)\.   | June 21, 2011 | 
|  SOAP API calls over HTTP disabled  |  To increase security, SOAP API calls over HTTP are disabled\. Authenticated and anonymous SOAP requests must be sent to Amazon S3 using SSL\.  | June 6, 2011 | 
|  IAM enables cross\-account delegation   |  Previously, to access an Amazon S3 resource, an IAM user needed permissions from both the parent AWS account and the Amazon S3 resource owner\. With cross\-account access, the IAM user now only needs permission from the owner account\. That is, If a resource owner grants access to an AWS account, the AWS account can now grant its IAM users access to these resources\.  For more information, see [Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.  For more information on specifying principals in a bucket policy, see [Principals](s3-bucket-user-policy-specifying-principal-intro.md)\.  | June 6, 2011 | 
|  New link  |  This service's endpoint information is now located in the AWS General Reference\. For more information, go to Regions and Endpoints in [AWS General Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)\.  | March 1, 2011 | 
|  Support for hosting static websites in Amazon S3  |  Amazon S3 introduces enhanced support for hosting static websites\. This includes support for index documents and custom error documents\. When using these features, requests to the root of your bucket or a subfolder \(e\.g\., `http://mywebsite.com/subfolder`\) returns your index document instead of the list of objects in your bucket\. If an error is encountered, Amazon S3 returns your custom error message instead of an Amazon S3 error message\. For more information, see [Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\.  |  February 17, 2011  | 
|  Response Header API Support  |  The GET Object REST API now allows you to change the response headers of the REST GET Object request for each request\. That is, you can alter object metadata in the response, without altering the object itself\. For more information, see [Getting objects](GettingObjectsUsingAPIs.md)\.  |  January 14, 2011  | 
|  Large object support  |  Amazon S3 has increased the maximum size of an object you can store in an S3 bucket from 5 GB to 5 TB\. If you are using the REST API you can upload objects of up to 5 GB size in a single PUT operation\. For larger objects, you must use the Multipart Upload REST API to upload objects in parts\. For more information, see [Uploading objects using multipart upload API](uploadobjusingmpu.md)\.  |  December 9, 2010  | 
|  Multipart upload  |  Multipart upload enables faster, more flexible uploads into Amazon S3\. It allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts\. For more information, see [Uploading objects using multipart upload API](uploadobjusingmpu.md)\.  |  November 10, 2010  | 
|  Canonical ID support in bucket policies  |  You can now specify canonical IDs in bucket policies\. For more information, see [Policies and Permissions in Amazon S3](access-policy-language-overview.md)   |  September 17, 2010  |

| Object Versioning | This release introduces object versioning\. All objects now can have a key and a version\. If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 gives all objects added to a bucket a unique version ID\. This feature enables you to recover from unintended overwrites and deletions\. For more information, see [Versioning](Introduction.md#Versions) and [Using Versioning](Versioning.md)\. | February 8, 2010 | 
| New Region supported | Amazon S3 now supports the US West \(N\. California\) Region\. The new endpoint for requests to this Region is s3\-us\-west\-1\.amazonaws\.com\. For more information, see [Buckets and Regions](UsingBucket.md#access-bucket-intro)\. | December 2, 2009 | 
| AWS SDK for \.NET | AWS now provides libraries, sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers who prefer to build applications using \.NET language\-specific API operations instead of REST or SOAP\. These libraries provide basic functions \(not included in the REST or SOAP APIs\), such as request authentication, request retries, and error handling so that it's easier to get started\. For more information about language\-specific libraries and resources, see [Using the AWS SDKs, CLI, and Explorers](UsingAWSSDK.md)\.  | November 11, 2009 |
