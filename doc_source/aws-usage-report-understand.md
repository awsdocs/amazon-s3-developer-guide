**Notes:**

1. For more information on the byte\-hours unit, see [Converting Usage Byte\-Hours to Billed GB\-Months](#aws-usage-report-understand-converting-byte-hours)\.

1. For objects that are archived to the GLACIER storage class, when they are deleted prior to 90 days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

1. For objects that are in STANDARD\_IA storage, when they are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class prior to 30 days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

1. For small objects that are in STANDARD\_IA storage, when they are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class prior to 30 days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

## Tracking Operations in Your Usage Reports<a name="aws-usage-report-understand-operations"></a>

Operations describe the action taken on your AWS object or bucket by the specified usage type\. Operations are indicated by self\-explanatory codes, such as `PutObject` or `ListBucket`\. To see which actions on your bucket generated a specific type of usage, use these codes\. When you create a usage report, you can choose to include **All Operations**, or a specific operation, for example, **GetObject**, to report on\.

## Converting Usage Byte\-Hours to Billed GB\-Months<a name="aws-usage-report-understand-converting-byte-hours"></a>

The volume of storage that we bill you for each month is based on the average amount of storage you used throughout the month\. You are billed for all of the object data and metadata stored in buckets that you created under your AWS account\. For more information about metadata, see [Object Key and Metadata](UsingMetadata.md)\. 

We measure your storage usage in TimedStorage\-ByteHrs, which are totaled up at the end of the month to generate your monthly charges\. The usage report reports your storage usage in byte\-hours and the billing reports report storage usage in GB\-months\. To correlate your usage report to your billing reports, you need to convert byte\-hours into GB\-months\.

For example, if you store 100 GB \(107,374,182,400 bytes\) of Standard Amazon S3 storage data in your bucket for the first 15 days in March, and 100 TB \(109,951,162,777,600 bytes\) of Standard Amazon S3 storage data for the final 16 days in March, you will have used 42,259,901,212,262,400 byte\-hours\.

First, calculate the total byte\-hour usage:

```
[107,374,182,400 bytes x 15 days x (24 hours/day)] 
    + [109,951,162,777,600 bytes x 16 days x (24 hours/day)]
    = 42,259,901,212,262,400 byte-hours
```

Then convert the byte\-hours to GB\-Months:

```
42,259,901,212,262,400 byte-hours/1,073,741,824 bytes per GB/24 hours per day
     /31 days in March 
     =52,900 GB-Months
```
