When granting permissions, you decide who is getting them, which Amazon S3 resources they are getting permissions for, and specific actions you want to allow on those resources\. 

## Amazon S3 Resources<a name="access-control-resources-basics"></a>

Buckets and objects are primary Amazon S3 resources, and both have associated subresources\. For example, bucket subresources include the following:
+ `lifecycle` – Stores lifecycle configuration information \(see [Object Lifecycle Management](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)\)\.
+ `website` – Stores website configuration information if you configure your bucket for website hosting \(see [Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\. 
+ `versioning` – Stores versioning configuration \(see [PUT Bucket versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTVersioningStatus.html)\)\. 
+ `policy` and `acl` \(access control list\) – Store access permission information for the bucket\. 
+ `cors` \(cross\-origin resource sharing\) – Supports configuring your bucket to allow cross\-origin requests \(see [Cross\-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\)](cors.md)\)\. 
+ `logging` – Enables you to request Amazon S3 to save bucket access logs\.

Object subresources include the following:
+ `acl` – Stores a list of access permissions on the object\. This topic discusses how to use this subresource to manage object permissions \(see [Managing Access with ACLs](S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.md)\)\.
+ `restore` – Supports temporarily restoring an archived object \(see [POST Object restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPOSTrestore.html)\)\. An object in the Glacier storage class is an archived object\. To access the object, you must first initiate a restore request, which restores a copy of the archived object\. In the request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist\. For more information about archiving objects, see [Object Lifecycle Management](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)\.

### About the Resource Owner<a name="about-resource-owner"></a>

By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private\. Only a resource owner can access the resource\. The resource owner refers to the AWS account that creates the resource\. For example:
+ The AWS account that you use to create buckets and objects owns those resources\. 
+ If you create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user in your AWS account, your AWS account is the parent owner\. If the IAM user uploads an object, the parent account, to which the user belongs, owns the object\. 
+ A bucket owner can grant cross\-account permissions to another AWS account \(or users in another account\) to upload objects\. In this case, the AWS account that uploads objects owns those objects\. The bucket owner does not have permissions on the objects that other accounts own, with the following exceptions:
  + The bucket owner pays the bills\. The bucket owner can deny access to any objects, or delete any objects in the bucket, regardless of who owns them\. 
  + The bucket owner can archive any objects or restore archived objects regardless of who owns them\. Archival refers to the storage class used to store the objects\. For more information, see [Object Lifecycle Management](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)\.

**Important**  
AWS recommends not using the root credentials of your AWS account to make requests\. Instead, create an IAM user, and grant that user full access\. We refer to these users as administrator users\. You can use the administrator user credentials, instead of root credentials of your account, to interact with AWS and perform tasks, such as create a bucket, create users, and grant them permissions\. For more information, go to [Root Account Credentials vs\. IAM User Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html) in the *AWS General Reference* and [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

The following diagram shows an AWS account owning resources, the IAM users, buckets, and objects\.

## Resource Operations<a name="access-control-resource-operations-basics"></a>

Amazon S3 provides a set of operations to work with the Amazon S3 resources\. For a list of available operations, go to [Operations on Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketOps.html) and [Operations on Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectOps.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference*\. 

## Managing Access to Resources \(Access Policy Options\)<a name="access-control-resources-manage-permissions-basics"></a>

Managing access refers to granting others \(AWS accounts and users\) permission to perform the resource operations by writing an access policy\. For example, you can grant `PUT Object` permission to a user in an AWS account so the user can upload objects to your bucket\. In addition to granting permissions to individual users and accounts, you can grant permissions to everyone \(also referred as anonymous access\) or to all authenticated users \(users with AWS credentials\)\. For example, if you configure your bucket as a website, you may want to make objects public by granting the `GET Object` permission to everyone\. 

Access policy describes who has access to what\. You can associate an access policy with a resource \(bucket and object\) or a user\. Accordingly, you can categorize the available Amazon S3 access policies as follows:

+ **Resource\-based policies** – Bucket policies and access control lists \(ACLs\) are resource\-based because you attach them to your Amazon S3 resources\.   
![\[Diagram depicting AWS account resources, including an S3 bucket with a bucket ACL and bucket policy, and S3 objects with object ACLs.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/images/resource-based-policy.png)

  + ACL – Each bucket and object has an ACL associated with it\. An ACL is a list of grants identifying grantee and permission granted\. You use ACLs to grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts\. ACLs use an Amazon S3–specific XML schema\. 

    The following is an example bucket ACL\. The grant in the ACL shows a bucket owner as having full control permission\. 

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <AccessControlPolicy xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
      <Owner>
        <ID>*** Owner-Canonical-User-ID ***</ID>
        <DisplayName>owner-display-name</DisplayName>
      </Owner>
      <AccessControlList>
        <Grant>
          <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
                   xsi:type="Canonical User">
            <ID>*** Owner-Canonical-User-ID ***</ID>
            <DisplayName>display-name</DisplayName>
          </Grantee>
          <Permission>FULL_CONTROL</Permission>
        </Grant>
      </AccessControlList>
    </AccessControlPolicy>
    ```

    Both bucket and object ACLs use the same XML schema\.

  + Bucket Policy – For your bucket, you can add a bucket policy to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users permissions for the bucket and the objects in it\. Any object permissions apply only to the objects that the bucket owner creates\. Bucket policies supplement, and in many cases, replace ACL\-based access policies\.

    The following is an example bucket policy\. You express bucket policy \(and user policy\) using a JSON file\. The policy grants anonymous read permission on all objects in a bucket\. The bucket policy has one statement, which allows the `s3:GetObject` action \(read permission\) on objects in a bucket named `examplebucket`\. By specifying the `principal` with a wildcard \(\*\), the policy grants anonymous access, and should be used carefully. For example, the following bucket policy would make objects publicly accessible\.

    ```
    {
        "Version":"2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect":"Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
                "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
+ **User policies** – You can use IAM to manage access to your Amazon S3 resources\. You can create IAM users, groups, and roles in your account and attach access policies to them granting them access to AWS resources, including Amazon S3\.   
![\[Diagram depicting the AWS account admin and other users with attached user policies.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/images/user-policy.png)

  For more information about IAM, see the [AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) product detail page\. 

  The following is an example of a user policy\. You cannot grant anonymous permissions in an IAM user policy, because the policy is attached to a user\. The example policy allows the associated user that it's attached to perform six different Amazon S3 actions on a bucket and the objects in it\. You can attach this policy to a specific IAM user, group, or role\.

  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "ExampleStatement1",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:PutObject",
                  "s3:GetObject",
                  "s3:ListBucket",
                  "s3:DeleteObject",
                  "s3:GetBucketLocation"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket"
              ]
          },
          {
              "Sid": "ExampleStatement2",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

When Amazon S3 receives a request, it must evaluate all the access policies to determine whether to authorize or deny the request\. For more information about how Amazon S3 evaluates these policies, see [How Amazon S3 Authorizes a Request](how-s3-evaluates-access-control.md)\.

## Which Access Control Method Should I Use?<a name="so-which-one-should-i-use"></a>

 With the options available to write an access policy, the following questions arise:
+ When should I use which access control method? For example, to grant bucket permissions, should I use a bucket policy or bucket ACL? I own a bucket and the objects in the bucket\. Should I use a resource\-based access policy or an IAM user policy? If I use a resource\-based access policy, should I use a bucket policy or an object ACL to manage object permissions?
+ I own a bucket, but I don't own all of the objects in it\. How are access permissions managed for the objects that somebody else owns? 
+ If I grant access by using a combination of these access policy options, how does Amazon S3 determine if a user has permission to perform a requested operation? 

 The following sections explain these access control alternatives, how Amazon S3 evaluates access control mechanisms, and when to use which access control method\. They also provide example walkthroughs\.
