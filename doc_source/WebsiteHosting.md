# Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3<a name="WebsiteHosting"></a>

You can host a static website on Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)\. On a static website, individual webpages include static content\. They might also contain client\-side scripts\. By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server\-side processing, including server\-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP\.NET\. Amazon S3 does not support server\-side scripting\. Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) also has resources for hosting dynamic websites\. To learn more about website hosting on AWS, go to [Websites and Website Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/websites/)\.

To host a static website, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting, and then upload your website content to the bucket\. The website is then available at the AWS Region\-specific website endpoint of the bucket:

```
s3.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>
```

For a list of AWS Region\-specific website endpoints for Amazon S3, see [Website Endpoints](WebsiteEndpoints.md)\. For example, suppose you create a bucket called `examplebucket` in the US West \(Oregon\) Region, and configure it as a website\.  The following example URLs provide access to your website content: 

+ This URL returns a default index document that you configured for the website\.

  ```
  https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/examplebucket/index.html
  ```

+ This URL requests the photo\.jpg object, which is stored at the root level in the bucket\.

  ```
  https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/examplebucket/photo.jpg
  ```

+ This URL requests the `docs/doc1.html` object in your bucket\. 

  ```
  https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/examplebucket/docs/doc1.html
  ```

**Using Your Own Domain**  
Instead of accessing the website by using an Amazon S3 website endpoint, you can use your own domain, such as `example.com` to serve your content\. Amazon S3, along with Amazon RouteÂ 53, supports hosting a website at the root domain\. For example, if you have the root domain `example.com` and you host your website on Amazon S3, your website visitors can access the site from their browser by typing either `http://www.example.com` or `http://example.com`\. For an example walkthrough, see [Example: Setting up a Static Website Using a Custom Domain](website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.md)\. 

To configure a bucket for website hosting, you add website configuration to the bucket\. For more information, see [Configuring a Bucket for Website Hosting](HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.md)\.
