# Uploading objects using presigned URLs<a name="PresignedUrlUploadObject"></a>

A presigned URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, provided that the creator of the presigned URL has permissions to access that object\. That is, if you receive a presigned URL to upload an object, you can upload the object only if the creator of the presigned URL has the necessary permissions to upload that object\. 

All objects and buckets by default are private\. The presigned URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions\. 

When you create a presigned URL, you must provide your security credentials and then specify a bucket name, an object key, an HTTP method \(PUT for uploading objects\), and an expiration date and time\. The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration\. That is, you must start the action before the expiration date and time\. If the action consists of multiple steps, such as a multipart upload, all steps must be started before the expiration, otherwise you will receive an error when Amazon S3 attempts to start a step with an expired URL\.

You can use the presigned URL multiple times, up to the expiration date and time\.

**Note**  
Anyone with valid security credentials can create a presigned URL\. However, for you to successfully upload an object, the presigned URL must be created by someone who has permission to perform the operation that the presigned URL is based upon\.

You can generate a presigned URL programmatically using the AWS SDK for Java, \.NET, Ruby, PHP, [Node\.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getSignedUrl-property), and [Python](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.generate_presigned_url)\.

 If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, you can also use AWS Explorer to generate a presigned object URL without writing any code\. Anyone who receives a valid presigned URL can then programmatically upload an object\. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 from AWS Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSToolkitVS/latest/UserGuide/using-s3.html)\. For instructions on how to install AWS Explorer, see [Using the AWS SDKs, CLI, and Explorers](UsingAWSSDK.md)\.

## Limiting presigned URL capabilities<a name="PresignedUrlUploadObject-LimitCapabilities"></a>

You can use presigned URLs to generate a URL that can be used to access your S3 buckets\. When you create a presigned URL, you associate it with a specific action\. You can share the URL, and anyone with access to it can perform the action embedded in the URL as if they were the original signing user\. The URL will expire and no longer work when it reaches its expiration time\. The capabilities of the URL are limited by the permissions of the user who created the presigned URL\. 

In essence, presigned URLs are a bearer token that grants access to customers who possess them\. As such, we recommend that you protect them appropriately\.

If you want to restrict the use of presigned URLs and all S3 access to particular network paths, you can write AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies that require a particular network path\. These policies can be set on the IAM principal that makes the call, the Amazon S3 bucket, or both\. A network\-path restriction on the principal requires the user of those credentials to make requests from the specified network\. A restriction on the bucket limits access to that bucket only to requests originating from the specified network\. Realize that these restrictions also apply outside of the presigned URL scenario\.

The IAM global condition that you use depends on the type of endpoint\. If you are using the public endpoint for Amazon S3, use `aws:SourceIp`\. If you are using a VPC endpoint to Amazon S3, use `aws:SourceVpc` or `aws:SourceVpce`\.

The following IAM policy statement requires the principal to access AWS from only the specified network range\. With this policy statement in place, all access is required to originate from that range\. This includes the case of someone using a presigned URL for S3\.

```
{
  "Sid": "NetworkRestrictionForIAMPrincipal",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "",
  "Resource": "",
  "Condition": {
    "NotIpAddressIfExists": { "aws:SourceIp": "IP-address" },
    "BoolIfExists": { "aws:ViaAWSService": "false" }
  }
}
```
